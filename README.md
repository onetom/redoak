Red Oak: A Responsive Blogging Template for Barley
======

[Barley](http://getbarley.com/) and Red Oak are being made by [Plain](http://plainmade.com/).

Modified to work with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) - which is open source -
instead of [Hammer](http://hammerformac.com/)
recommended by [this Barley news article](http://getbarley.com/news/3014/using-github-hammer-for-mac-apache-and).

Just run `jekyll serve --watch` then open http://localhost:4000/

In case you want a very simple method to checkout any folder with static HTML content,
I would highly recommend something which is also bundled with Macs:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer	# then visit http://localhost:8000

or

    sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80	# then visit http://localhost

Then you don't have to fiddle around with the ugly Apache config...
You can only run it once though, but many times it's enough.
